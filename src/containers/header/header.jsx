          One of main reasons of peopleâ€™s death all along the world. Especially
          old people, people with obesity, and many other people have risk of
          Cardiac Arrest. When sudden Cardiac Arrest strikes, heart suddenly and
          unexpectedly stops beating effectively and blood flow stops. Without
          any intervention, the brain, vital organs, and our heart will begin to
          die. Brain damage will start to set in within four minutes and after
          10 minutes, brain damage becomes irreversible.
