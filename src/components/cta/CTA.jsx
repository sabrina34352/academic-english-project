          It does take time to get the blood moving with CPR so it is very
          important to PUSH HARD and PUSH FAST to build the pressure up, which
          keeps blood going to the brain. Pushing down at least 2 inches allows
          for the heart to be squeezed and blood to move out. Pushing at a rate
          of 100-120compresions per minute is necessary to keep blood pumping.
          Pushing not deep enough causes blood to not reach the brain. The same
          for not pushing fast enough. Pushing too fast is also not allowed.
          Heart does not have time to refill with blood when pushing is too
          fast, therefore not enough blood gets pumped out. Not allowing the
          body to decompress and not allowing the chest to fully recoil is also
          prohibited. The heart does not have a chance to refill with blood,
          therefore no blood gets pumped out. So remember, the key purpose of
          delivering compression is to keep oxygenated blood moving within the
          heart and up to the brain to keep the brain alive. It is crucial to
          PUSH HARD and PUSH FAST in the center of the chest. If ribs break,
          that’s okay. What’s not okay is allowing the brain to die from a lack
          of oxygen. Finally, don’t give up until medical help arrives or an AED
          is present.
